"""algo/corporate_actions.py — corporate-action ticker exclusion + auto-detection.

Single source of truth for "which tickers are excluded because of a stock split
or rights issue". A CA re-bases the price series, so historical entries, MAs and
P&L computed across the event date are meaningless — the ticker is dropped from
Portfolio, BSJP signal generation and trade-done history rather than corrected.

Only status='confirmed' rows exclude anything. 'suspected' rows are auto-detected
and awaiting admin review — they are surfaced in the UI but must NOT affect any
calculation. 'rejected' rows are tombstones that stop the detector re-flagging.
